Side project in development.  This is a Google Go implementation of the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) using message passing via the structured grid parallel programming paradigm.  Yes, there is a really easy [Matlab matrix shifting implementation](http://www.mathworks.com/moler/exm/chapters/life.pdf) of the Game of Life, but I want to give this a shot for learning and comparison.

Mini-goal: interface with the [plaintext *.cells* file format](http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Plaintext).
